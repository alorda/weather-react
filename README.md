# Weather React

_Hello! When I deploy this project, it probably won't be called "weather-react". For now, that's a plain and appropriate name for it. Although... I do want the theme of the page to 'react' to the search result, so maybe I'll leave the name alone. The name is probabl not original so, yeah, I will probably ditch it._

## Objective:
The goal of this app was to create a simple React project based on what I learned from a tutorial on Udemy and from the intro exercises on the official React page. Also, although I really like front-end work, I don't get a chance to do much of it, especially with "mainstream" or "modern" front-end libraries and tools.

I'm encountering some interesting problems that I intend to solve. I'm thinking that as I solve them, I can mark those tasks as complete. In case you're wondering, yes, I am familiar with Agile methodology, sprints, etc., however, I'm working alone and I think it's overkill.

## Stuff to solve:


### The main kinds of issues or enhancements that are my focus are:
* API Issues
* Error handling
* Improving relevance of search results
* Building a lovely UI based on search results

I'm creating and tracking issues using this tool: [Weather-React Board on Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/alorda/weather-react)

## Additional and Miscellaneous Info:
### Software Tools
* If you need more info, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
* I'm using this API: https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api
* Plain CSS and maybe I'll also use CSS Grid!

### Hardware (random, I know but sometimes we are curious about these matters)
* Input Club White Fox "True Fox" layout/ Vortex Race 3
* Logitech MX Master 2 mouse
* 2015 Macbook Air
* Logitech 29" ultrawide display (the budget version)
* Electric standing desk
* Exercise ball for a chair when sitting
